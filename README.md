# ECE Capstone Demo

This is the working baseline for our Senior Design Project, webDAQ.

## Important

To clone the repository use the command `git clone --recursive https://www.github.com/cwlucas41/webdaq`. This is necessary because the project uses a git submodule for the ADC sampling code that needs to be initialized. 

If this is not done, the submodule can be updated manually with the command `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

For more info on submodules, please see the [working with submodules page](https://github.com/blog/2104-working-with-submodules)

## Note

The certificate files included in this repo are disabled, and are included for example use only.
